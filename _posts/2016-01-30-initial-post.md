# Creating blog

Maybe this is my third time in my life to create a blog. Creating blog seems to be self-assertive, so I hadn't wanted to do it at all. However I felt I wanna write something suddenly. I say that the purpose to creating blog is just a reminder, but perhaps it is like self-assertive something, and it doesn't matter anymore.

Maybe I write about programming, book reviews. I wanna be conscience about writing in English, but sometimes(often?) in Japanese.
