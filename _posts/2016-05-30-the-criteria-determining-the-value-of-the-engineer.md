There are various kinds of engineers, and there are the criteria determining the engineer is good or bad, I think. Surely, the technic is very very important, but the mind is also important. The criteria is related to the mind set.

So, The nice engineer is a man of action. He is always willing to destroy current code and recreate even from zero. When he find something bad, he doesn't neglect it so long and act for it. What makes him so? Maybe he is tidy and cannot help keeping everything beautiful. The velocity of product's growing may be slow, but the code will be very beautiful and can be managed easily by also the other engineers; In that sense, the velocity can be fast, and above all, the engineering will be excited!

The opposite enginner, who is unwilling to touch current code, does't take care of current code and implements new feature by adding new code as possible. This leads code base to become dirtier and dirtier, then the enginner dislike the code base more and more.

The important thing is, of course, the engineers should clean up codes in the early stages. THe enginner is ought to do it. And my motto is that I have to clean up current code base breavely no matter how dirty it is. Even if the other enginner doesn' to do it, I have to do it and that is very valuable for the other enginners, me, and the product.
