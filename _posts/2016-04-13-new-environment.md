description: As a college student and an engineer

## What's new?

- I moved up to the fourth year and became a member of <a href="http://www.iba.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/" target="_blank">Iba & Hasegawa lab</a>.
- I left the workplace where I belonged for a year and 3 months.
- I joined two teams as a (mainly) Rails / iOS engineer

## As a college student

I spent 3 years as a college student without such a diligent working because I've been more interested in practical tech such as Rails or Swift and so on than scholastic achievements.

However, now, I wanna achieve something exciting in academic area.

I've learned programming mainly used in creating something like 'Service'. It is very exciting, but sometimes I feel empty because the tech advances very fast and the skill as a used as just a way to create something becomes unusable. I think, through learning these kinds of skills, I have to be conscious of that it is the most important to learn universal and abstractive knowledges.

Then, looking back, the knowledges taught at college is very attractive and prescious. I'm now willing to learn much at college, mainly AI or algorithm.

## As an engineer

However, I love Rails or Swift or something like these, but there is little change in my feelings; I wanna learn more and more kinds of language, library or tools. More widely than deeply. I'm not interested in too small tips such as how to use the method, how to pass the error but in language's outlook on the world or somethin like design pattern.

I wanna be a more flexible engineer, who can acquire the new things continuously (of course is very interested in new thigns) and doesn't care if his skills has been out of date, above all, loves tech.

## As a worker

Oh by the way, the reason why I moved the working environment is that I wanna work as a more engineer-like engineer. I wanna taught by an experienced engineers, I wanna read huger source code, I wanna touch the service I've not known.

The environment I had belonged to makes me exciting, happy, more interested in tech, learn programming from a beginner to not a beginner, so I'm very grateful. However, with above reasons, no matter how excellent the environment is, I move to the next environment. That may be attributable to my youth.

I enjoy much the environment I belong to now. Writing more practical code, taking reviews by experienced engineers, talking with residents who live in another world I had not known. Everyday exciting, everyday new.
