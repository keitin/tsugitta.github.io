## The purpose of working

Generally there seems to be two purposes of working. One is to earn money, the other is to gain experience.

Considering the worker is a college student, in many cases he(she) works for the former purpose. It's because he just wanna enjoy the university life, and needs money to do so. Most college students would rather not work if he has enough money.

## To work to obtain a wide perspective

However, cannot we think that it's waste of time to work just to earn pocket money in the prescious college days? Some says that it's foolish to work to earn a little money while paying expensive school fee and not studying hard. That's true of course, but I think that it's very mottainai primarily because there seems to be a great working style which can be had only by those who are not an adult.

I think that the park of being a college student is that he is not and cannot be a regular employee. He is just a part-time worker and not required anymore. Therefore, he can work at not only one place without any hesitation.

Working at some places is very very valuable, I think. Knowing various corporate cultures, touching various services, reading the source codes of the type which he has never seen, talking with a lot of people. How can it have a bad influence on him? Never. It's very important especially because he is a college student before belonging to a company!

Working to obtain a wide perspective can be done by college students, and they should obtain it. Do not overdo pursuit of money, do think your working vision.
