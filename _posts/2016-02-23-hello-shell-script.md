To post blog, I had created a new file, changed the title, arranged the format of it's header for jekyll. That's really annoying... so I made easy shell scripts to post easily. Source code is <a href="https://github.com/tsugitta/tsugitta.github.io/tree/master/bin" target="_blank">here</a>.

Amazing! It saved me a lot of trouble. Though this is a very easy example, maybe those who can use shell script easily save a lot of time; furthermore, It may be exciting to write shell script, I think.

I'll try to think about using shell script when I faced a mechanical operation, even if it's an easy one.
